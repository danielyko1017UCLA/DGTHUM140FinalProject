# Analysis of Labor between Ethnicity, Gender, and Other Factors


## Description
This analysis aims to look for patterns and/or correlations between labor status in the US (eg. employed, unemployed, civilian labor force) and other factors such as ethnicity (eg. White, Asian, African-American) and gender (eg. male or female). These will be compared against each other to provide different insights into what may be related with each other. In order to expand on this analysis, other datasets with other factors such as cost of living and average income may be included as this notebook is being developed. Also, datasets with more up-to-date labor data may be included as well. The primary libraries that will be used are pandas and matplotlib, although other libraries may be used depending on what the other datasets may require for cleaning or web scraping. 

## Questions to Answer
- Are there major differences in employment between ethnicities in the US?
- Are men or women more likely to be employed in the US?
- Is there a specific combination of ethnicity and gender that is more likely to be employed or less likely to be employed?
- What is the most common type of employment for a given ethnicity or gender?
